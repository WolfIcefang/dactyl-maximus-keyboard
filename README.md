# The Dactyl Maximus gaming keyboard
Dactyl Maximus is a split-hand gaming keyboard with interchangeable thumb cluster modules.

This readme explains *what* the Dactyl Maximus is.
* If you want to learn *how* to build one for yourself, follow the GitHub Pages build guide here: https://wolficefang.github.io/dactyl-maximus-keyboard/
* If you want to customize your Dactyl Maximus or contribute to the project, please peruse the wiki: https://github.com/WolfIcefang/dactyl-maximus-keyboard/wiki

## First off, what is a Dactyl?

The Dactyl keyboard is a 3d printed mechanical keyboard. Each half has a "bowl" of keys arranged in a grid. Each column in the grid is curved to match the length of your fingers. The Dactyl also has an array of keys for the thumb called the thumb cluster. There have been many forks of the Dactyl GitHub page, most famously the Dactyl Manuform, the Tightyl, and the Bastyl. 

## How does the Dactyl Maximus stand out from the crowd?

The most significant difference between the Dactyl-like keyboards are their thumb clusters. It's clear that there is no universally perfect cluster design. To address this situation, the thumb clusters on the Dactyl Maximus are interchangeable; they are printed independently of the bowls. A standardized "mounting plate" file can be found in **coming soon** and the wiki has a list of popular cluster designs. **coming later**

Dactyl Maximus should also be easier to print than previous Dactyl models. Each bowl is printed in 6 parts: top plate, bottom plate, and four side panels. This allows extensive customization of the keyboard after it has been assembled. Mouse wheels, joysticks, arrow keys, and rotary encoders can be attached to any side. **coming last**

To facilitate swappable components, Dactyl Maximus will officially have 1 bowl size: 5 rows by 6 columns. Much like the original Dactyl, these parameters can be changed by the brave. However, if you are looking to create a keyboard with fewer keys and greater portability, I recommend the Corne keyboard: https://github.com/foostan/crkbd

### Why is Dactyl Maximus a "gaming" keyboard?

The original Dactyl keyboard was designed by programmers, for programmers, and it shows. The guide for software installation is a few bullet points with tips, and the wiring instructions are, I quote, "A very rough guide for the brave". In contrast, the Dactyl Maximus will inherit the best traits of gaming keyboards: A simple setup experience, reliable operation, convenient software, exposed switches, and of course, 16.8 million colors of per-key RGB backlighting.

To achieve this, a significant amount of effort is being put into the beginner build guide on GitHub Pages. It will list everything, from recommended components, to finding public 3D printers, to learning to solder. A successful build guide is how I will judge the success of the Dactyl Maximus project. I want anyone, provided the build guide, to go from "no prior keyboard knowledge" to "functional masterpiece" within a month. **Coming sooner or later.**

Finally, labelling the Dactyl Maximus a gaming keyboard takes some stress off the project for me. It lowers the bar, in a way. I believe Dactyls can compete with the quality of big name brands, but competing against $500 group buys would be madness. Calling the Dactyl Maximus a gaming keyboard serves another purpose: I use it as a way to avoid calling it an ergonomic keyboard.  The human body is really, *really* complicated; I don't feel qualified to say that this board has real health benefits.

## That being said, if we're going to 3D print our own keyboards, there's no more wickedly radical way to do it than the Dactyl. 

***The following is the original Dactyl's description. I still need it for a few things, and the video is a good watch.
TODO: Figure out how copyright works, and get it from 2015 to 2021!***

There's a talk about the motivation and design of the Dactyl that helps provide context for this repo:

## Assembly

### Generating a Design

**Setting up the Clojure environment**
* [Install the Clojure runtime](https://clojure.org)
* [Install the Leiningen project manager](http://leiningen.org/)
* [Install OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

**Generating the design**
* Run `lein repl`
* Load the file `(load-file "src/dactyl_keyboard/dactyl.clj")`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files

**Tips**
* [Some other ways to evaluate the clojure design file](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28213489)
* [Example designing with clojure](http://adereth.github.io/blog/2014/04/09/3d-printing-with-clojure/)


### Printing
Pregenerated STL files are available in the [things/](things/) directory.

### Wiring
Masks for the flexible PCBs I used are available for the [left](resources/pcb-left.svg) and [right](resources/pcb-right.svg) side.

A [very rough guide for the brave is here](guide/README.org#wiring) - It will be improved over time (**TODO**)!
